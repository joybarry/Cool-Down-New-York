    <p>Without the NY Heat Act, the gas business can expand and the burning of fossil fuels can further destroy the environment. Greener alternatives are left unexplored when gas is readily accessible. The limit on utility costs per household would relieve many New York families from financial burden. Some concerns that explain the resistance to this bill are that jobs will disappear and consumers will lose their freedom to choose their energy source. To the first point, we would say that the gas company jobs lost will be replaced by opportunities to participate in clean energy initiatives. To the second point, we would respond by saying that people shouldnâ€™t be able to choose harmful options for their energy if there is a cleaner alternative. New York will only be in the position to do that if we are given the time and space to work on these new plans. 
    So how can the NY Heat Act gain more traction? Write a letter to the Governor or your local assembly member, outlining your concerns and urging them to deliver on these important issues.
